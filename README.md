## *Marvin* is a library for integrating Large Language Model into your software. 
- It's a lightweight framework for perfectionists, a module for tinkerers, and a place to copy/paste for purists.
- It's delightfully opinionated at every layer you choose to use it. 
- It's customizable, ejectable, and most important fully open source.

### *Marvin* is ergonomics-first.
- We're obsessed with the accessibility, speed, reliability, and feel of building with LLMs. 
- We're building with typesafety, observability, orchestration, and tracing as first class citizens.
- We're looking for others who share our mission: join our Discord or open a PR. 

### It's what you'd build, *if you had the time*. 
- You know Python? You know Marvin.
- You can use as much or as little as Marvin as you'd like, we've built it for incremental adoption. 
- You can use LLMs in `ambient mode`, in the dialect you know best. 

### Quick Install
`pip install marvin`

### What you can build with Marvin in 5 minutes. We're serious, time it.
Our community is on a constant listening tour with developers, engineers, founders, and investors to surface the most valuable design patterns. We ship quickly, thoughtfully, and purposefully to enable others to build simply, quickly, and confidently.
