## Functions

### `fn`
```python
def fn(func: Callable[P, T] | None = None, instructions: str | None = None, agent: Agent | None = None, thread: Thread | str | None = None) -> Callable[P, T]
```
A decorator that predicts the output of a Python function without executing it.

Can be used with or without parameters:
    @fn
    def my_function(): ...

    @fn(instructions="Be precise")
    def my_function(): ...

The decorated function accepts additional kwargs:
    - _agent: Override the agent at call time
    - _thread: Override the thread at call time

If the function does not have a return annotation, the result will be
returned as a string and attempted to be parsed as JSON.

The decorated function also gains an as_task() method that returns the underlying
marvin Task without executing it.

Args:
    func: The function to decorate
    instructions: Optional instructions to guide the prediction
    agent: Optional custom agent to use
    thread: Optional thread for maintaining conversation context

Returns:
    A wrapped function that predicts output instead of executing
