### `extract`
```python
def extract(data: Any, target: TargetType[T] | None = None, instructions: str | None = None, agent: Agent | None = None, thread: Thread | str | None = None, context: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> list[T]
```
Extracts entities of a specific type from the provided data.

This function uses a language model to identify and extract entities of the
specified type from the input data. The extracted entities are returned as a
list.

Args:
    data: The input data to extract entities from. Can be any type.
    target: The type of entities to extract. Defaults to str.
    instructions: Optional additional instructions to guide the extraction.
        Used to provide specific guidance about what to extract or how to
        process the data. Required when target is str.
    agent: Optional custom agent to use for extraction. If not provided,
        the default agent will be used.
    thread: Optional thread for maintaining conversation context. Can be
        either a Thread object or a string thread ID.
    context: Optional dictionary of additional context to include in the task.

Returns:
    A list of extracted entities of type T.

Raises:
    ValueError: If target is str and no instructions are provided.
