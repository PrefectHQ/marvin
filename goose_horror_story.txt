Morty was taking a leisurely stroll around the serene Silver Lake at dusk, enjoying the cool autumn breeze. The golden leaves crunched underfoot, and the reflections of trees danced in the murky waters. However, the tranquility was shattered when a long shadow loomed upon Morty’s path. From the reeds emerged a solitary goose, its eyes glinting with a malevolent intelligence. Morty quickened his pace, but the goose mirrored his speed, waddling faster, honking wildly – a sound less avian and more demonic.

As Morty broke into a run, the goose took flight, wings thumping against the air with a sinister rhythm. Panic-stricken, Morty glanced over his shoulder, only to meet the piercing gaze of the creature, its beak open in a silent scream. He veered off the trail, his heart pounding a frantic staccato, but it was too late. The furious fowl descended upon him, pecking and flapping with relentless fury.

Through the chaos, as his cries mixed with the relentless honks echoing across the lake, Morty realized the truth – this was no ordinary bird. This was an avian nightmare, an unrelenting specter of goose-kind. The night swallowed his pleas, leaving only the echo of wingbeats beneath the moonlit sky.
