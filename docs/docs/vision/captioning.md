# Captioning images

Marvin can use OpenAI's vision API to process images as inputs. 

!!! tip "Beta"
    Please note that vision support in Marvin is still in beta, as OpenAI has not finalized the vision API yet. While it works as expected, it is subject to change.

!!! example

    Generate a description of the following image, hypothetically available at `/path/to/marvin.png`:

    ![](/assets/images/docs/vision/marvin.webp)

    
    ```python
    import marvin
    from pathlib import Path

    caption = marvin.beta.caption(image=Path('/path/to/marvin.png'))
    ```

    !!! success "Result"
    
        "This is a digital illustration featuring a stylized, cute character resembling a Funko Pop vinyl figure with large, shiny eyes and a square-shaped head, sitting on abstract wavy shapes that simulate a landscape. The whimsical figure is set against a dark background with sparkling, colorful bokeh effects, giving it a magical, dreamy atmosphere."
