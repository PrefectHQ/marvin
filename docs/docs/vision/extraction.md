# Extracting entities from images

Marvin can use OpenAI's vision API to process images and convert them into structured data, transforming unstructured information into native types that are appropriate for a variety of programmatic use cases.

The `marvin.beta.extract` function is an enhanced version of `marvin.extract` that accepts images as well as text.


!!! tip "Beta"
    Please note that vision support in Marvin is still in beta, as OpenAI has not finalized the vision API yet. While it works as expected, it is subject to change.

  This involves a two-step process: first, a caption is generated for the image that is aligned with the structuring goal. Next, the actual extract operation is performed with an LLM.

    We will extract the breed of each dog in this image:

    ```python
    import marvin
    
    img = marvin.beta.Image('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548199973-03cce0bbc87b?q=80&w=2969&auto=format&fit=crop&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D')

    result = marvin.beta.extract(img, target=str, instructions='dog breeds')
    ```

    !!! success "Result"
        ```python
        result == ['Pembroke Welsh Corgi', 'Yorkshire Terrier']
        ```
