We're thrilled you're interested in Marvin! Here, we're all about community. Marvin isn't just a tool, it's a platform for developers to collaborate, learn, and grow. We're driven by a shared passion for making Large Language Models (LLMs) more accessible and easier to use.

### Connect on Discord or Twitter

The heart of our community beats in our Discord server. It's a space where you can ask questions, share ideas, or just chat with like-minded developers. Don't be shy, join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Kgw4HpcuYG) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AskMarvinAI)!

### Contributing to Marvin

Remember, Marvin is _your_ tool. We want you to feel at home suggesting changes, requesting new features, and reporting bugs. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Issues:** Encountered a bug? Have a suggestion? Open an issue in our [GitHub repository]({{ repo_url }}). We appreciate your input!

- **Pull Requests (PRs):** Ready to contribute code? We welcome your pull requests! Not sure how to make a PR? Check out the [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

- **Discord Discussions:** Have an idea but not quite ready to open an issue or PR? Discuss it with us on Discord first!

Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable. Don't worry about not being an expert or making mistakes. We're here to learn and grow together. Your input helps Marvin become better for everyone.

Stay tuned for community events and more ways to get involved. Marvin is more than a project â€“ it's a community. And we're excited for you to be a part of it!
