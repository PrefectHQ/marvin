    "In addition to how you define the AI model itself, there are two ways to control its behavior at runtime: `instructions` and `model`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Providing instructions\n",
    "When parsing text, AI Models can take up to three different forms of instruction:\n",
    "- the AI Model's docstring (set at the class level)\n",
    "- instructions passed to the `@ai_model` decorator (set at the class level)\n",
    "- instructions passed to the AI Model when instantiated (set at the instance / call level)\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI Model's docstring and the `@ai_model` instructions are roughly equivalent: they are both provided when the class is defined, not when it is instantiated, and are therefore applied to every instance of the class. Users can choose to put information in either location. If you only want to use one, our recommendation is to use the docstring for clarity. Alternatively, you may prefer to put the model's documentation in the docstring (as you would for a normal Pydantic model) and put parsing instructions in the `@ai_model` decorator, since those are unique to the LLM. This is entirely a matter of preference and users should opt for whichever is more clear; both the docstring and the `@ai_model` instructions are provided to the LLM in the same way.\n",
