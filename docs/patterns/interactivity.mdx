Marvin allows agents to interact with users through the command line interface (CLI). This is useful for:

- Gathering user input during task execution
- Creating interactive chatbots
- Building conversational interfaces
- Getting user confirmation or choices
- Providing real-time feedback

Note that this is not a replacement for a proper user interface, and is intended primarily for local prototyping and development.

## Enabling CLI Interaction


To enable CLI interaction for a task, set the `cli` parameter to `True`:

```python
import marvin

# Get user input
name = marvin.run(
    "Ask for the user's name",
    cli=True
)

print(f"The user's name is: {name}")
```


## Interactive Conversations

Use threads to maintain context in interactive conversations:

```python
import marvin

with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    # Get user preferences
    preferences = marvin.run(
        "Ask about the user's movie preferences",
        cli=True
    )

    # Make a recommendation
    recommendation = marvin.run(
        "Recommend a movie based on their preferences"
    )

    # Ask for feedback
    feedback = marvin.run(
        "Ask if they'd like another recommendation",
        cli=True
    )
```


## Example: Interactive Survey

Here's a complete example of an interactive survey:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin
from typing import Literal

class Survey(marvin.Model):
    name: str
    age: int
    interests: list[str]
    experience_level: Literal["beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"]

with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    # Create an interactive agent
    agent = marvin.Agent(
        name="Surveyor",
        cli=True,
        instructions="Conduct a friendly survey about programming experience."
    )

    # Run the survey
    result = marvin.run(
        "Conduct a programming survey",
        agents=[agent],
        result_type=Survey
    )

print(result)
```

```text Result
Agent: Hi! I'd like to ask you a few questions about your programming experience.
What's your name?

User: Alice

Agent: Nice to meet you, Alice! Could you tell me your age?

User: 25

Agent: Thanks! What programming languages or technologies are you interested in?
Please list them separated by commas.

User: Python, JavaScript, Machine Learning

Agent: Great interests! How would you rate your overall programming experience level?
Choose one: beginner, intermediate, or advanced

User: intermediate

Survey(
    name='Alice',
    age=25,
    interests=['Python', 'JavaScript', 'Machine Learning'],
    experience_level='intermediate'
)
```
