A tool is a Python function that your agents can use to accomplish tasks. Tools extend an agent's capabilities beyond their built-in knowledge and abilities, allowing them to interact with external systems, perform calculations, or access specific information.

Tools can be:
- Simple utility functions for common operations
- Complex data processing operations
- API calls to external services
- File system operations
- Database queries
- System commands
- Custom business logic

Here's a basic example of a tool for rolling dice:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin
import random

def roll_die() -> int:
    """Roll a 6-sided die."""
    return random.randint(1, 6)

rolls = marvin.run("Roll a die four times", tools=[roll_die])

print(rolls)
```
```text Result
[3, 1, 4, 2]
```
</CodeGroup>

## Creating Tools

Any Python function can be used as a tool. The function's name, docstring, and type hints help agents understand what the tool does and how to use it:

```python
from typing import Annotated

def get_weather(
    location: Annotated[str, "The 5 or 9-digit zip code"],
) -> Annotated[float, "The temperature in Fahrenheit"]:
    """Fetch weather data for the specified location."""
    # Implementation details...
```

## Using Tools

Tools can be provided to tasks or agents. When a tool is provided to a task, any agent working on that task will have access to the tool. When a tool is provided to an agent, the agent can use the tool in any task it is assigned to:

```python
import marvin

def search_database(query: str) -> list:
    """Search the product database for items matching the query."""
    # Implementation details...

# Provide tools to a task
task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Find products matching 'blue shirt'",
    tools=[search_database]
)

# Or provide tools to an agent
agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="ProductBot",
    tools=[search_database]
)
```

## Common Use Cases

Tools are particularly useful for:
- Accessing external APIs or services
- Performing calculations or data processing
- File operations and data manipulation
- Database queries and updates
- System interactions
- Custom business logic
- Integration with existing code
