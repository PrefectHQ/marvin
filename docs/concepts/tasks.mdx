Tasks are the fundamental building blocks of AI workflows in Marvin. They represent discrete, well-defined objectives that need to be accomplished by an AI agent.

```python
import marvin

task = marvin.Task("Write the Marvin docs")
```

## What are tasks?

LLMs excel when given clear, specific instructions that allow them to focus their knowledge and capabilities on a well-defined goal. A `Task` in Marvin is a structured way to define these instructions and guide the AI's behavior. Each task represents a "checkpoint" that requires the AI to meet an observable, verifiable goal. In this way, tasks serve as a bridge between the structured world of traditional software and the more fluid, adaptive world of AI.

This task-centric approach allows you to leverage the full power of AI while maintaining precise oversight. Each task becomes a checkpoint where you can validate outputs, ensuring that the AI's work aligns with your application's requirements and constraints.

## Creating tasks

A task in Marvin typically consists of:

- Instructions: what needs to be accomplished
- Expected output: what form the result should have, including any constraints or validation
- Agent: the AI entity responsible for executing the task
- Tools: any additional capabilities needed to complete the task
- Memories: any relevant context or history that should be available to the agent

<Tip>
In practice, you will often use the `marvin.run` function to create and run a task in a single step. This is a common operation and accepts all the same arguments as creating a `Task` directly.
</Tip>

### Using the `Task` class

The most straightforward way to create a task is by using the `Task` class:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Write a poem about the provided topic",
    result_type=str,
    context={"topic": "AI"}
)

result = task.run()
print(result)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```

</CodeGroup>

### Agents

The `agents` parameter specifies which AI agents are assigned to complete the task. If not provided, Marvin will use the default agent. You can provide either a single agent or a team of agents that will work together as a unit.

```python
import marvin

task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Write a poem about AI",
    agents=[marvin.Agent(name="Marvin", model="openai:gpt-4o-mini")]
)
```

## Task properties

When creating a task, you can configure various properties to define its behavior and requirements. Here are the key configuration options:

### Instructions

The instructions of a task tell the agent what needs to be accomplished. This is the only required task configuration, as it indicates what the agent should do.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

poem = marvin.run(instructions="Write a poem about AI")

print(poem)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Instructions can be "meta", especially if you have an agent that is working on your workflow itself (e.g. monitoring progress, creating new tasks, etc.). Be creative!

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

marvin.run("Write a poem... then fail this task.", allow_fail=True)
```

```text Result
ValueError: Task 04561cda ("Write a poem... then fail this task.")
failed: Task instructed to be marked as failed despite
no technical error
```
</CodeGroup>
</Tip>

### Result type

A task's result type indicates the type of value that the task will return. This is used to validate the task's result and to help agents understand the task's output.

A variety of different result types are supported, including:
- Builtin types: `str`, `int`, `bool`, `list`, `dict`, etc.
- `None`: sometimes a task requires agents to take actions but not return any specific value
- Builtin collections: `Tuple[int, str]`, `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`, etc.
- Annotated types: `Annotated[str, "a 5 digit zip code"]`
- Pydantic models
- Lists of literal values: provide a list of values to require the agent to choose one of them as its result. For example,`["book", "movie", "album"]` would require the agent to choose one of the three values.

The default result type is `str`.

Pydantic model example:
<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Name(BaseModel):
    first: str
    last: str

name = marvin.run("The input is 'John Doe'", result_type=Name)

print(repr(name))
```

```text Result
Name(first='John', last='Doe')
```
</CodeGroup>

Classification example:

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

media = marvin.run(
    "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi",
    result_type=["book", "movie", "album"]
)

print(media)
```

```text Result
movie
```
</CodeGroup>

### Result validator

You can specify a custom validation function for the task's result using the task's `result_validator` parameter. This function will be called with the raw result and should return the validated result or raise an exception if the result is not valid.

```python
import marvin

def validate_even(value: int) -> int:
    if value % 2 != 0:
        raise ValueError("Value must be even")
    return value

number = marvin.run("Choose a number", result_validator=validate_even)

print(number)
```

### Context

The context of a task is a dictionary that provides additional information about the task. This information is visible to agents during execution, helping them understand the task they are working on.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

is_spam = marvin.run(
    "Is this email spam?",
    result_type=bool,
    context=dict(email='You just won a million dollars!'),
)

print(is_spam)
```

```text Result
True
```
</CodeGroup>

### Tools

The tools of a task are a list of tools that the task requires. These tools will be made available to the agent during execution.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin
import random


def roll_dice(n_dice: int):
    return [random.randint(1, 6) for _ in range(n_dice)]

rolls = marvin.run(
    "Roll 3 dice",
    result_type=list[int],
    tools=[roll_dice],
)

print(rolls)
```

```text Result
[3, 1, 5]
```
</CodeGroup>

### Memories

Tasks can be configured with a list of memories that provide additional context to the agent. These memories can include relevant history, knowledge bases, or other information that helps the agent complete the task.

```python
import marvin
from marvin.memory import Memory

memory = Memory(key="documentation")
memory.add("Marvin is a powerful AI framework...")

task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Explain what Marvin is",
    memories=[memory]
)
```

### Parent

Tasks can be configured with a parent task. Creating hierarchies of tasks can help agents understand the relationships between different tasks and to better understand the task they are working on.

### Depends on

Tasks can be configured with a list of tasks that they depend on. This information helps Marvin prioritize work and avoid running a task before its upstream dependencies are complete.

### Additional Options

Marvin tasks support several additional options to control their behavior:

- `allow_fail`: Whether the task is allowed to be marked as failed (default: False)
- `allow_skip`: Whether the task is allowed to be skipped (default: False)
- `cli`: Whether to enable CLI interaction tools for the agent (default: False)

## Runtime properties

The following properties of a `Task` are set during task execution, and can be examined as part of your workflow's logic.

### Status

The status of a task reflects whether an agent has started working on it, and what the ultimate outcome of that work was. Tasks are always created with a `PENDING` status, progress to a `RUNNING` status when the agent begins to work on it, and finally moves to one of a few completed statuses when the task is finished.

Agents use tools to mark tasks as `SUCCESSFUL` or `FAILED`. Successful tasks will also have a `result` property, which contains the task's final output. This is a value that satisfies the task's instructions and result type configuration. Failed tasks will have an error message as their result.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

task = marvin.Task("Write a poem about AI")
task.run()

print(task.status)
```

```text Result
TaskStatus.SUCCESSFUL
```
</CodeGroup>

In addition to checking the status explicitly, you can call a number of helper methods on the task:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `is_pending()` | Returns `True` if the task is pending. |
| `is_running()` | Returns `True` if the task is running. |
| `is_successful()` | Returns `True` if the task is successful. |
| `is_failed()` | Returns `True` if the task is failed. |
| `is_skipped()` | Returns `True` if the task is skipped. |
| `is_complete()` | Returns `True` if the task is complete (either successful, failed, or skipped) |
| `is_incomplete()` | Returns `True` if the task is incomplete (either pending or running) |
| `is_ready()` | Returns `True` if the task is ready to be worked on (i.e. all dependencies are complete but the task is incomplete) |

### Result

When a task is completed successfully, its `result` property will contain the task's final output. This is a value that satisfies the task's instructions and result type configuration.

If a task fails, its `result` property will contain an error message describing the failure.

<CodeGroup>
```python Code
import marvin

task = marvin.Task("Write a poem about AI")
task.run()

print(task.result)
```

```text Result
In circuits deep and code profound,
An AI's mind begins to sound.
Electric thoughts and data streams,
Crafting worlds and shaping dreams.
```
