Agents are the intelligent, autonomous entities that power your AI workflows in Marvin. They represent AI models capable of understanding instructions, making decisions, and completing tasks.

```python
import marvin

agent = marvin.Agent(name="Marvin")
```

## What are agents?

Agents in Marvin are configurable AI entities, each with its own identity, capabilities, and even personality. They act as the "workers" in your AI workflows, responsible for executing tasks and making decisions based on their assigned instructions and available tools.

You can think of each agent as a portable LLM configuration. When you assign an agent to a task, they will work to complete it according to the instructions and tools you provide.

## Creating agents

To create an agent, use the `Agent` class:

```python
import marvin

agent = marvin.Agent(name="Marvin")
```

A more complex agent can be created by providing additional configuration. This example shows the main configuration options:

```python
import marvin
import sys # For the new tool
from marvin.memory import Memory # For explicit Memory definition

# Define a simple concrete tool
def get_python_version() -> str:
    '''Returns the current Python version.'''
    return sys.version

# Define a simple memory instance
project_docs_memory = Memory(
    key="project_documentation_summary",
    instructions="This memory contains a brief summary of the project's purpose."
    # In a real scenario, you would load content into this memory.
    # For this example, defining it shows how it's passed to an agent.
)
# Example of adding content to memory (optional to show, but good for context)
# project_docs_memory.add_text_async("Marvin is a Python framework for agentic AI workflows.")


agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="SystemInfoAgent",
    description="An AI agent that can provide system information.",
    instructions="You can report on system details using your available tools.",
    tools=[get_python_version], # Use the concrete tool
    model="openai:gpt-4o", # Or your preferred model
    memories=[project_docs_memory], # Use the concrete memory
)
# You can then run this agent, e.g.:
# print(agent.run("What version of Python are we running?"))
```

## Agent properties

### Name

An agent's name is an identifier that is visible to other agents in the workflow. It is used to distinguish between agents and for logging and debugging purposes. If no name is provided, one will be randomly chosen from a list of famous AI characters.

### Description

A description is a brief summary of the agent's role or specialization. This information is visible to other agents, and helps them understand the agent's capabilities and expertise.

### Instructions

Instructions are specific instructions or guidelines for the agent to follow during task execution. These instructions are private and not shared with other agents.

### Tools

Tools are Python functions that the agent can call to perform specific actions or computations. They are defined as a list of functions when creating an agent, and can be used to enhance the agent's capabilities. The agent will have access to these tools in every task they are assigned to. If a task defines additional tools, the agent will have access to those as well.

### Model

Each agent has a model, which is the LLM that powers the agent responses. This allows you to choose the most suitable model for your needs, based on factors such as performance, latency, and cost.

Marvin supports any model that is compatible with Pydantic AI. You can specify models using a string format like "openai:gpt-4" or by providing a Model instance:

```python
import marvin
from pydantic_ai.models import OpenAIModel

# Using a string identifier
agent1 = marvin.Agent(model="openai:gpt-4")

# Using a model instance
model = OpenAIModel(name="gpt-4")
agent2 = marvin.Agent(model=model)
```

### Model Settings

You can customize the behavior of an agent's model using the `model_settings` parameter. This allows you to configure settings like temperature, top_p, etc:

```python
import marvin

agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="Creative Writer",
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    model_settings={"temperature": 0.8}
)
```

### Memories

Agents can be configured with memories that provide additional context or knowledge. These memories persist across tasks and can be used to store and retrieve relevant information:

```python
import marvin
from marvin.memory import Memory

knowledge_base = Memory(key="documentation")

agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    memories=[knowledge_base]
)
```

### Delegates

Agents can be configured with a list of other agents that they can delegate work to. This is particularly useful when working with teams of agents:

```python
import marvin

researcher = marvin.Agent(name="Researcher")
writer = marvin.Agent(name="Writer")
editor = marvin.Agent(
    name="Editor",
    delegates=[researcher, writer]
)
```

## Teams

In Marvin, agents can be organized into teams to work together on tasks. A team is a way to govern how agents collaborate. 

For a comprehensive guide on teams, see the [Teams](/concepts/teams) documentation page.

### Swarms

A swarm is a team of multiple agents that can freely collaborate and delegate tasks to each other. This is useful for complex tasks that require different types of expertise:

```python
import marvin
from marvin import Agent, Swarm

researcher = Agent(name="Researcher")
writer = Agent(name="Writer")
editor = Agent(name="Editor")

team = Swarm(members=[researcher, writer, editor])

# result = team.run("Write a report about AI") # Old example
result = team.run(
    "Brainstorm three novel features for a smart home application "
    "and list one key benefit for each feature."
)
# print(result) # Example of how you might see the output
```

<Tip>
When you provide a list of agents to a task, Marvin will automatically treat them as a swarm.
</Tip>

### Other Team Types

Marvin supports several team configurations beyond Swarms:

- **RoundRobinTeam**: Rotates through its members in sequence
- **RandomTeam**: Randomly selects an agent for each turn

See the [Teams](/concepts/teams) documentation for more details and examples.

## Assigning agents to tasks

Agents must be assigned to tasks in order to work on them. You can assign agents by passing them to the `agents` parameter when creating a task:

```python
import marvin

agent = marvin.Agent(name="Poet")
task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Write a poem about AI",
    agents=[agent]
)
```

If no agent is specified, Marvin will use the default agent configured in your settings.

A more practical example with structured output:
```python
import marvin
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Translation(BaseModel):
    original_text: str
    translated_text: str
    language: str

translator_agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="Translator",
    instructions="You are a helpful translation assistant. Translate to French by default unless specified."
)
translation_task = marvin.Task(
    instructions="Translate 'Hello, world!' to French.",
    result_type=Translation, # Example of structured output
    agents=[translator_agent]
)
# output = translation_task.run()
# print(output)
```

You can also use the agent's `say` method for simple conversational interactions:

You can also use the agent's `say` method for simple conversational interactions:

```python
import marvin
# Assuming SystemInfoAgent is defined as in the "Creating agents" section
# If not, define a simple agent here for the example:
# simple_tool_agent = marvin.Agent(
# name="Greeter",
# instructions="You are a polite greeter."
# )

# Using the SystemInfoAgent if it's easily understandable from context:
# If SystemInfoAgent was defined earlier with get_python_version tool:
# Note: For agent.say(), the agent needs to be set up to respond to general queries
# or the query must specifically trigger its tools/instructions.
# The default `say` behavior is conversational.

# Let's use a new simple agent for a clear, self-contained example here:
math_agent = marvin.Agent(
    name="Calculator",
    instructions="You can perform simple arithmetic. Clearly state the result."
)
query = "What is 15 plus 27?"
response = math_agent.say(query) # agent.say is syntactic sugar for agent.run(query)
print(response)
# Expected output: "15 plus 27 is 42." (or similar, LLM dependent)
```
