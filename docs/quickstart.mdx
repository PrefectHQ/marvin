Welcome to Marvin! This quickstart guide will walk you through the three main ways to use Marvin to create AI-powered applications.

You'll learn how to:
1. [Use quick one-liners](#quick-one-liners) with `marvin.run()`
2. [Work with specialized agents](#specialized-agents) using `agent.run()`
3. [Control tasks directly](#task-control) with `task.run()`
4. [Add advanced features](#advanced-features) like context and threads

<Warning>
This guide assumes you have already installed `marvin`. See the [installation docs](/installation) for instructions.
</Warning>

## Quick One-Liners

The fastest way to use Marvin is with `marvin.run()`:

```python
import marvin
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Category(BaseModel):
    label: str
    confidence: float

# Run a simple classification task
text_to_classify = "This new phone is amazing, I love the camera!"
classification_result = marvin.run(
    f"Classify the sentiment of this text: '{text_to_classify}'",
    result_type=Category
)
print(classification_result)
# Expected output structure: Category(label='positive', confidence=0.95)

class Keyword(BaseModel):
    word: str

# With a specific result type
keywords = marvin.run(
    "Generate three relevant keywords for 'sustainable energy solutions'",
    result_type=list[Keyword] # Changed from List[Keyword]
)
print(keywords)
# Expected output structure: [Keyword(word='renewable'), Keyword(word='solar'), Keyword(word='wind')]
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
label='positive' confidence=0.95

[Keyword(word='renewable'), Keyword(word='solar'), Keyword(word='wind')]
```
</Accordion>

## Specialized Agents

Create and use specialized agents for specific types of tasks:

```python
from marvin import Agent

# Create a specialized agent
writer = Agent(
    name="Technical Writer",
    instructions="Write clear, engaging content for developers"
)

from pydantic import BaseModel # Should be present

class ArticleSummary(BaseModel):
    title: str
    summary: str

# Use the agent directly
article_summary = writer.run(
    "Write a short article about Python type hints, providing a title and a brief summary.",
    result_type=ArticleSummary
)
print(article_summary)
# Expected output structure: ArticleSummary(title='Python Type Hints Explained', summary='Type hints in Python improve code clarity and help catch errors early...')
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
title='Python Type Hints Explained' summary='Type hints in Python bring clarity and safety to your code without sacrificing its dynamic nature. Introduced in Python 3.5, they allow developers to explicitly declare variable and function types, making code more maintainable and easier to understand, helping catch errors early and improve IDE support.'
```
</Accordion>

## Task Control

For full control over your AI workflows, create and run tasks directly:

```python
import httpx
from marvin import Task
from pydantic import BaseModel

def check_weather(location: str) -> str:
    url = f"https://wttr.in/{location}?format=%C+%t"
    return httpx.get(url).text

# Define a structured output type
class WeatherForecast(BaseModel):
    temperature: float
    conditions: str
    precipitation_chance: float | str = "unknown"

# Create a task with specific requirements
task = Task(
    instructions="Get the weather for San Francisco",
    result_type=WeatherForecast,
    tools=[check_weather]  # Custom tools
)

# Run the task
forecast = task.run()
print(forecast)
```

<Accordion title="Output">
```text
temperature=50.0 conditions='Partly cloudy' precipitation_chance='unknown'
```
</Accordion>

## Advanced Features

All three approaches support advanced features like context, threads, and tools:

```python
import marvin
from marvin import Agent, Task

# Context improves results
data = "The patient reports mild fever and fatigue."
diagnosis = marvin.run(
    "Suggest possible conditions",
    context={"medical_notes": data}
)

# Threads maintain conversation history
with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    # Ask multiple related questions
    marvin.run("What is quantum computing?")
    marvin.run("How does that relate to classical computing?")
    marvin.run("What are its practical applications?")

# Teams of agents can collaborate
researcher = Agent("Researcher")
writer = Agent("Technical Writer")
editor = Agent("Editor")

with marvin.Thread() as thread:
    research = researcher.run("Research quantum computing")
    draft = writer.run("Write an article", context={"research": research})
    final = editor.run("Edit the article", context={"draft": draft})
```
