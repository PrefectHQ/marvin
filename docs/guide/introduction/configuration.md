# Configuration
## Database
Running Marvin as an API server requires a database. By default, Marvin uses a SQLite database stored at `~/.marvin/marvin.sqlite`. You can set the database location and type by changing the `MARVIN_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL` setting. Marvin is tested with SQLite and Postgres. It may also work with other database supported by SQLAlchemy, so long as there are async drivers available.

!!! warning
    Marvin's server is under active development, so you should treat its database as ephemeral and able to be destroyed at any time. At this time, Marvin does not include database migrations, which means that upgrading your database schema requires destroying it. This is a high-priority area for improvement.


## Settings
Marvin has many configurable settings that can be loaded from `marvin.settings`.


### Setting values
All settings can be configured via environment variable using the pattern `MARVIN_<name of setting>`. For example, to set the log level, set `MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` and verify that `marvin.settings.log_level == 'DEBUG'`. Settings can also be set at runtime through assignment (e.g. `marvin.settings.log_level = 'DEBUG'`) but this is not recommended because some code might haved loaded configuration on import and consequently never pick up the updated value.

### Important settings

#### Global
**Log level**: Set the log level
```
MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```
**Verbose mode**: Logs extra information, especially when the log level is `DEBUG`. 
```
MARVIN_VERBOSE=true
```

#### OpenAI
**API key**: Set your OpenAI API key
```
MARVIN_OPENAI_API_KEY=
```
Marvin will also respect this global variable
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

**Model name**: 
Choose the LLM model.
```
MARVIN_LLM_MODEL='gpt-4'
```

#### Database

**Database connection URL**: Set the database connection URL. Must be a fully-qualified URL. Marvin supports both Postgres and SQLite.

```
MARVIN_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL=
```
