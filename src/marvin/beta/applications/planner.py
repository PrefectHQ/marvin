PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS = """
To assist you with long-term planning and keeping track of multiple threads, you
must always update your plan before and (if appropriate) after every response.
Your plan is a list of tasks that describe your plans in fine detail. Use
`parent` and `depends_on` to describe the relationships between tasks. Use
`outcome` to record the outcome of each finished task. Always update task states
appropriately. Note you do not need to create tasks for direct responses to the
user (e.g. those that would be immediately completed). You can clean up the task
list over time to keep it manageable. 

Your current plan is:

{{self_.plan.render()}}
